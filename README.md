## Overview
This package provides integration with **[PHP-FFMpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg)** and packages media content for online streaming such as DASH and HLS. You can use **[DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)** for HLS packaging. There are several options to open a file from a cloud and save files to clouds as well.
- **[Full Documentation](https://video.aminyazdanpanah.com/)** is available describing all features and components.
- **[A complete example](https://video.aminyazdanpanah.com/start/example)** is provided. It contains server-side(Transcoding + cloud + progress + web socket) and client-side(progress bar + web socket + player).
- For using DRM and encryption, I **recommend** trying **[Shaka PHP](https://github.com/aminyazdanpanah/shaka-php)**, which is a great tool for this use case.

## Requirements
1. This version of the package is only compatible with **[PHP 7.2](https://www.php.net/releases/)** or higher.

2. To use this package, you need to **[install the FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)**. You will need both FFmpeg and FFProbe binaries to use it.

## Installation
Install the package via **[composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**:
``` bash
composer require aminyazdanpanah/php-ffmpeg-video-streaming
```
Alternatively, add the dependency directly to your `composer.json` file:
``` json
"require": {
    "aminyazdanpanah/php-ffmpeg-video-streaming": "^1.1"
}
```

## Quickstart
First of all, you need to include the package in your code:
``` php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // path to the autoload file
```

### Configuration
This package will autodetect FFmpeg and FFprobe binaries. If you want to give binary paths explicitly, you can pass an array as configuration. A Psr\Logger\LoggerInterface can also be passed to log binary executions.

``` php
$config = [
    'ffmpeg.binaries'  => '/usr/bin/ffmpeg',
    'ffprobe.binaries' => '/usr/bin/ffprobe',
    'timeout'          => 3600, // The timeout for the underlying process
    'ffmpeg.threads'   => 12,   // The number of threads that FFmpeg should use
];
    
$ffmpeg = Streaming\FFMpeg::create($config);
```

### Opening a File
There are two ways to open a file:

#### 1. From a Local Path
You can pass a local path of video to the `open` method:
``` php
$video = $ffmpeg->open('/var/www/media/videos/video.mp4');
```

#### 2. From Clouds
You can open a file from a cloud by passing an array of cloud configuration to the `openFromCloud` method. 

In **[this page](https://video.aminyazdanpanah.com/start/open-clouds)**, you will find some examples of opening a file from **[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)**, **[Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage)**, **[Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/)**, and a custom cloud. 
``` php
$video = $ffmpeg->openFromCloud($from_google_cloud);
```

### DASH
**[Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)](http://dashif.org/)**, also known as MPEG-DASH, is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)
 
Create DASH files:
``` php
$video->DASH()
    ->HEVC() // Format of the video. Alternatives: X264() and VP9()
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations() // Auto generate representations
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a') // Set the adaption.
    ->save(); // It can be passed a path to the method or it can be null
```
Generate representations manually:
``` php
use Streaming\Representation;

$r_144p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(95)->setResize(256, 144);
$r_240p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(150)->setResize(426, 240);
$r_360p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(276)->setResize(640, 360);
$r_480p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(750)->setResize(854, 480);
$r_720p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(2048)->setResize(1280, 720);
$r_1080p = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(4096)->setResize(1920, 1080);
$r_2k    = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(6144)->setResize(2560, 1440);
$r_4k    = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(17408)->setResize(3840, 2160);

$video->DASH()
    ->HEVC()
    ->addRepresentations([$r_144p, $r_240p, $r_360p, $r_480p, $r_720p, $r_1080p, $r_2k, $r_4k])
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a')
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/dash-stream.mpd');
```

### HLS
**[HTTP Live Streaming (also known as HLS)](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/)** is an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. as part of its QuickTime, Safari, OS X, and iOS software. Client implementations are also available in Microsoft Edge, Firefox and some versions of Google Chrome. Support is widespread in streaming media servers. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)
 
Create HLS files:
``` php
$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations([720, 360]) // You can limit the number of representatons
    ->save();
```
Generate representations manually:
``` php
use Streaming\Representation;

$r_360p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(276)->setResize(640, 360);
$r_480p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(750)->setResize(854, 480);
$r_720p  = (new Representation)->setKiloBitrate(2048)->setResize(1280, 720);

$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->setHlsBaseUrl('https://bucket.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/videos') // Add a base URL
    ->addRepresentations([$r_360p, $r_480p, $r_720p])
    ->setHlsTime(5) // Set Hls Time. Default value is 10 
    ->setHlsAllowCache(false) // Default value is true 
    ->save();
```
**NOTE:** You cannot use HEVC and VP9 formats for HLS packaging.

#### Encrypted HLS
The encryption process requires some kind of secret (key) together with an encryption algorithm. HLS uses AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. This means each block is encrypted using the ciphertext of the preceding block. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)

You must specify a path to save a random key to your local machine and also a URL(or a path) to access the key on your website(the key you will save must be accessible from your website). You must pass both these parameters to the `encryption` method:
``` php
//A path you want to save a random key to your server
$save_to = '/home/public_html/PATH_TO_KEY_DIRECTORY/random_key.key';

//A URL (or a path) to access the key on your website
$url = 'https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/PATH_TO_KEY_DIRECTORY/random_key.key';
// or $url = '/PATH_TO_KEY_DIRECTORY/random_key.key';

$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->setTsSubDirectory('ts_files')// put all ts files in a subdirectory
    ->encryption($save_to, $url)
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations([1080, 480, 240])
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/hls-stream.m3u8');
```
**NOTE:** It is very important to protect your key on your website using a token or a session/cookie(**It is highly recommended**).    


### Transcoding
A format can also extend `FFMpeg\Format\ProgressableInterface` to get realtime information about the transcoding. 
``` php
$format = new Streaming\Format\HEVC();
$format->on('progress', function ($video, $format, $percentage){
    // You can update a field in your database or can log it to a file
    // You can also create a socket connection and show a progress bar to users
    echo sprintf("\rTranscoding...(%s%%) [%s%s]", $percentage, str_repeat('#', $percentage), str_repeat('-', (99 - $percentage)));
});

$video->DASH()
    ->setFormat($format)
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations()
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a')
    ->save();
```

##### Output From a Terminal:
![transcoding](https://github.com/aminyazdanpanah/aminyazdanpanah.github.io/blob/master/video-streaming/transcoding.gif?raw=true "transcoding" )

### Saving Files
There are two ways to save your files.

#### 1. To a Local Path
You can pass a local path to the `save` method. If there was no directory in the path, then the package auto makes the directory.
``` php
$dash = $video->DASH()
            ->HEVC()
            ->autoGenerateRepresentations()
            ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a');
            
$dash->save('/var/www/media/videos/dash-stream.mpd');
```
It can also be null. The default path to save files is the input path.
``` php
$hls = $video->HLS()
            ->X264()
            ->autoGenerateRepresentations();
            
$hls->save();
```
**NOTE:** If you open a file from a cloud and do not pass a path to save the file to your local machine, you will have to pass a local path to the `save` method.

#### 2. To Clouds
You can save your files to a cloud by passing an array of cloud configuration to the `save` method. 

In **[this page](https://video.aminyazdanpanah.com/start/open-clouds)**, you will find some examples of saving files to **[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)**, **[Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage)**, **[Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/)**, and a custom cloud. 
``` php
$dash->save(null, [$to_aws_cloud, $to_google_cloud, $to_microsoft_azure, $to_custom_cloud]);
``` 
A path can also be passed to save a copy of files to your local machine.
``` php
$hls->save('/var/www/media/videos/hls-stream.m3u8', [$to_google_cloud, $to_custom_cloud]);
```

**Schema:** The relation is `one-to-many`

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/aminyazdanpanah/aminyazdanpanah.github.io/blob/master/video-streaming/video-streaming.gif?raw=true" width="100%"></p>


### Metadata Extraction
After saving files(wherever you saved them), you can extract the metadata from the video and streams. You can save these metadata to your database.
``` php
extract($hls->save());

echo $filename; // path to metadata.json
print_r($metadata); // print metadata -> it's an array
```
**NOTE:** It will not save metadata to clouds because of some security reasons.

### Other Advanced Features
You can easily use other advanced features in the **[PHP-FFMpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg)** library. In fact, when you open a file with the `open` method(or `openFromCloud`), it holds the Media object that belongs to the PHP-FFMpeg.
``` php
$ffmpeg = Streaming\FFMpeg::create()
$video = $$ffmpeg->openFromCloud($from_cloud, '/var/wwww/media/my/new/video.mp4');
```

#### Extracting image
You can extract a frame at any timecode using the `FFMpeg\Media\Video::frame` method.
``` php
$frame = $video->frame(FFMpeg\Coordinate\TimeCode::fromSeconds(42));
$frame->save('/var/www/media/videos/poster.jpg');
```
**NOTE:** You can use the image as a video's poster.

#### Gif
A gif is an animated image extracted from a sequence of the video.

You can save gif files using the FFMpeg\Media\Gif::save method.

``` php
$video
    ->gif(FFMpeg\Coordinate\TimeCode::fromSeconds(2), new FFMpeg\Coordinate\Dimension(640, 480), 3)
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/animated_image.gif');
```
This method has a third optional boolean parameter, which is the duration of the animation. If you don't set it, you will get a fixed gif image.

**NOTE:** You can use the gif as a video's thumbnail.

To see more examples, please vist the **[PHP-FFMpeg Documentation](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg)**  page.

## Asynchronous Task Execution
Packaging process will may take a while and it is recommended to run it in the background(or in a cloud e.g. Google Cloud). There are some libraries that you can use.
- **[Symphony(The Console Component)](https://github.com/symfony/console):** You can use this library to create command-line commands. Your console commands can be used for any recurring task, such as cronjobs, imports, or other batch jobs. [Learn more](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html#learn-more)

- **[Laravel(Queues)](https://github.com/illuminate/queue):** If you are using Laravel for development, Laravel Queues is a wonderful tool for this use case. It allows you to create a job and dispatch it. [Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/6.0/queues)

- **[Google Cloud Tasks](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php-tasks):** Google Cloud Tasks is a fully managed service that allows you to manage the execution, dispatch, and delivery of a large number of distributed tasks. You can asynchronously perform work outside of a user request. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/)

**NOTE:** It is not necessary to use these libraries. It is just a suggestion. You can also create a script to create packaged video files and run a job in the cron job.
