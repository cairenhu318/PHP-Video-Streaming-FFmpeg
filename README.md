This package provides an integration with [PHP-FFmpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg) and packages well-known live streaming techniques such as DASH and HLS. Also you can use DRM for HLS packaging.

- [Full Documentation](https://video.aminyazdanpanah.com/)

- ****NOTE:****  For DRM and encryption(DASH and HLS), I **strongly recommend** to try **[Shaka PHP](https://github.com/aminyazdanpanah/shaka-php)**, which is a great tool for this use case.


## Required Libraries

This library requires a working FFMpeg. You will need both FFMpeg and FFProbe binaries to use it.
- Getting FFmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Also, for HLS encryption you will need a working OpenSSL:
- Getting OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/source/
- Getting OpenSSL(Windows): https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

## Installation

This version of the package is only compatible with PHP 7.1.0 and later.

Install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require aminyazdanpanah/php-ffmpeg-video-streaming
```

## Basic Usage

``` php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; 

// the path to a video or it can be a URL
$input_path = '/var/www/media/videos/test.mp4';// or "https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/my_sweetie.mp4"

//You can transcode videos using a callback method.
//If you do not want to transcode video, do not pass it(it can be null).
$listener = function ($audio, $format, $percentage) {
    echo "$percentage% is transcoded\n";
};

//The path you want to save your files.
//Also, it can be null - the default path is the input path.
$output_path_dash = '/var/www/media/videos/test/dash/output.mpd'; //or null
$output_path_hls = null; //or '/var/www/media/videos/test/hls/output.m3u8';
$output_path_encrypted_hls = '/var/www/media/videos/test/hls/output.m3u8'; // or null

//Path to acceess the key on your website.
// NOTE: It is highly recommended to protect the key using a token or a session/cookie.
$url_to_key = "https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/enc.key";
//Path to save the random key on your server.
$path_to_save_key = "/var/www/media/keys/my_key/enc.key";

$result_dash = dash($input_path, $output_path_dash, $listener); //Create dash files.
$result_hls = hls($input_path, $output_path_hls, $listener, $hls_key_info); //Create hls files.
$result_encrypted_hls = encrypted_hls($input_path, $output_path_encrypted_hls, $listener, $url_to_key, $path_to_save_key); //Create encrypted hls files

//dupm the results
var_dump($result_dash, $result_hls, $result_encrypted_hls);
```

## Usage

- [Full Documentation](https://video.aminyazdanpanah.com/)

### Configuration

FFMpeg will autodetect ffmpeg and ffprobe binaries. If you want to give binary paths explicitly, you can pass an array as configuration. A Psr\Logger\LoggerInterface can also be passed to log binary executions.

``` php
$config = [
    'ffmpeg.binaries'  => '/usr/bin/ffmpeg',
    'ffprobe.binaries' => '/usr/bin/ffprobe',
    'timeout'          => 3600, // The timeout for the underlying process
    'ffmpeg.threads'   => 12,   // The number of threads that FFMpeg should use
    ];
    
$ffmpeg = Streaming\FFMpeg::create($config);
```


### Opening a File

There are two ways to open a file:

#### 1. From Local
You can pass a local path of video to the `open` method:

``` php
$video = $ffmpeg->open('/var/www/media/videos/test.mp4');
```

#### 2. From Cloud
You can open a file by passing a URL to `fromURL` method:

``` php
$video = $ffmpeg->fromURL("https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/my_sweetie.mp4");
```

Also, the path to save the file, the method of request, and [request options](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/request-options.html) can be passed to the method.

### DASH
**[Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)**, also known as MPEG-DASH, is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers.

Similar to Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) solution, MPEG-DASH works by breaking the content into a sequence of small HTTP-based file segments, each segment containing a short interval of playback time of content that is potentially many hours in duration, such as a movie or the live broadcast of a sports event. The content is made available at a variety of different bit rates, i.e., alternative segments encoded at different bit rates covering aligned short intervals of playback time. While the content is being played back by an MPEG-DASH client, the client uses a bit rate adaptation (ABR) algorithm to automatically select the segment with the highest bit rate possible that can be downloaded in time for playback without causing stalls or re-buffering events in the playback. The current MPEG-DASH reference client dash.js offers both buffer-based (BOLA) and hybrid (DYNAMIC) bit rate adaptation algorithms. Thus, an MPEG-DASH client can seamlessly adapt to changing network conditions and provide high quality playback with fewer stalls or re-buffering events.

#### Auto Create DASH Files
``` php
$video->DASH()
    ->HEVC() // Format of the video. For Using another format, see Traits\Formats
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations() // Auto generate representations
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a') // Set the adaption.
    ->save(); // It can be passed a path to the method or it can be null
```


#### Create Representations Manually
Create multi-representations video files using `Representation` object:

``` php
$rep_1 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(800)->setResize(1080 , 720);
$rep_2 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(300)->setResize(640 , 360);

$video->DASH()
    ->HEVC() // Format of the video.For Using another format, see Traits\Formats
    ->addRepresentation($rep_1) // Add a representation
    ->addRepresentation($rep_2) // Add a representation
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a') // Set a adaption.
    ->save(); // It can be passed a path to the method or it can be null

```


#### Transcoding

You can transcode videos using the `on` method in the format class.
 
 Transcoding progress can be monitored in realtime, see Format documentation in [FFMpeg documentation](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg#documentation) for more information.

``` php
$format = new Streaming\Format\HEVC();

$format->on('progress', function ($video, $format, $percentage) {
    echo "$percentage% is transcoded\n";
});

$video->DASH()
    ->setFormat($format)
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations()
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a')
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/dash/test.mpd');

```

### HLS

**[HTTP Live Streaming (also known as HLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)** is an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. as part of its QuickTime, Safari, OS X, and iOS software. Client implementations are also available in Microsoft Edge, Firefox and some versions of Google Chrome. Support is widespread in streaming media servers.

HLS resembles MPEG-DASH in that it works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small HTTP-based file downloads, each download loading one short chunk of an overall potentially unbounded transport stream. A list of available streams, encoded at different bit rates, is sent to the client using an extended M3U playlist.

 - [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)
 
``` php
$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations() // Auto generate representations
    ->save(); // It can be passed a path to the method or it can be null
```

Create multi-qualities video files using `Representation` object:

``` php
$rep_1 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(1000)->setResize(1080 , 720);
$rep_2 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(500)->setResize(640 , 360);
$rep_3 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(200)->setResize(480 , 270);

$video->HLS()
    ->X264() 
    ->addRepresentation($rep_1) // Add a representation
    ->addRepresentation($rep_2) // Add a representation
    ->addRepresentation($rep_3) // Add a representation
    ->setHlsTime(5) // Set Hls Time. Default value is 10 
    ->setHlsAllowCache(false) // Default value is true 
    ->save();
```
See [HLS options](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#hls-2) for more information.

#### Transcoding

``` php
$format = new Streaming\Format\X264();

$format->on('progress', function ($video, $format, $percentage) {
    echo "$percentage% is transcoded\n";
});

$video->HLS()
    ->setFormat($format)
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations()
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/dash/test.m3u8');
```

#### Encrypted HLS

The encryption process requires some kind of secret (key) together with an encryption algorithm.

HLS uses AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. This means each block is encrypted using the cipher text of the preceding block. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)

Before we can encrypt videos, we need an encryption key. However you can use any software that can generate key, this package requires a working OpenSSL to create the key:

Getting OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/source/

Getting OpenSSL(Windows): https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

You need to pass both 'URL to Key' and a path to save a random key:
``` php
//Path to access the key on your website
$url = "https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/enc.key";

//Path to save a random key on your server
$path = "/var/www/my_website_project/storage/enc.key";

$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->generateRandomKeyInfo($url, $path)
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations()
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/hls/test.m3u8');
```
- **Note:** Alternatively, you can generate a key info using another library and pass the path to the `setHlsKeyInfoFile` method.
- **NOTE:** It is very important to protect your key on your website using a token or a session/cookie(****It is highly recommended****).
    
    (e.x. https://wwww.aminyazdanpanah.com/enc.key?tk=J5HLhi97Tjk4N).
    
- **NOTE:** For getting the benefit of the OpenSSL binary detection in windows, you need to add it to your system path otherwise, you have to pass the path to OpenSSL binary to the `generateRandomKeyInfo` method explicitly. 

### Other Advanced Features
You can easily use other advanced features in the [PHP-FFMpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg) library. In fact, when you open a file with `open` method, it holds the Media object that belongs to the PHP-FFMpeg.

- [Full PHP-FFMpeg Documentation](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg#documentation)

``` php
$ffmpeg = Streaming\FFMpeg::create()
$video = $$ffmpeg->fromURL("https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/my_sweetie.mp4", "/var/wwww/media/my/new/video.mp4");
```
#### Extracting image
ou can extract a frame at any timecode using the `FFMpeg\Media\Video::frame` method.

``` php
$video
    ->filters()
    ->extractMultipleFrames(FFMpeg\Filters\Video\ExtractMultipleFramesFilter::FRAMERATE_EVERY_10SEC, '/path/to/destination/folder/')
    ->synchronize();

$video
    ->save(new FFMpeg\Format\Video\X264(), '/path/to/new/file');
```

#### Clip
Cuts the video at a desired point. Use input seeking method. It is faster option than use filter clip.

``` php
$clip = $video->clip(FFMpeg\Coordinate\TimeCode::fromSeconds(30), FFMpeg\Coordinate\TimeCode::fromSeconds(15));
$clip->filters()->resize(new FFMpeg\Coordinate\Dimension(320, 240), FFMpeg\Filters\Video\ResizeFilter::RESIZEMODE_INSET, true);
$clip->save(new FFMpeg\Format\Video\X264(), 'video.avi');
```

#### Watermark
Watermark a video with a given image.

``` php
$video
    ->filters()
    ->watermark($watermarkPath, array(
        'position' => 'absolute',
        'x' => 1180,
        'y' => 620,
    ));
```
