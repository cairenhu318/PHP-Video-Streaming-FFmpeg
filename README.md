## Overview
This package provides integration with **[PHP-FFMpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg)** and packages media content for online streaming such as DASH and HLS. You can also use DRM for HLS packaging. There are options to open a file from clouds and also save files to clouds.
- This package uses FFmpeg, so before you get started, take the time to read the **[FFmpeg documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html)**.
- **[Full Documentation](https://video.aminyazdanpanah.com/)** is available describing all features and components.
- For DRM and encryption, I **recommend** trying **[Shaka PHP](https://github.com/aminyazdanpanah/shaka-php)**, which is a great tool for this use case.

## Requirements
1. This version of the package is only compatible with PHP 7.2 or higher.

2. To use this package, you need to install the **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)**. You will need both FFmpeg and FFProbe binaries to use it.

## Installation
Install the package via **[composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**:
``` bash
composer require aminyazdanpanah/php-ffmpeg-video-streaming
```
Alternatively, add the dependency directly to your `composer.json` file:
``` json
"require": {
    "aminyazdanpanah/php-ffmpeg-video-streaming": "^1.1"
}
```

## Quickstart
First of all, you need to include the package in Your Code:
``` php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // path to the autoload file
```
**Note:** If you are using such a framework(e.g. **[Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)**) that auto include the autoload in your code, then you can skip this step.

### Configuration
This package will autodetect FFmpeg and FFprobe binaries. If you want to give binary paths explicitly, you can pass an array as configuration. A Psr\Logger\LoggerInterface can also be passed to log binary executions.

``` php
$config = [
    'ffmpeg.binaries'  => '/usr/bin/ffmpeg',
    'ffprobe.binaries' => '/usr/bin/ffprobe',
    'timeout'          => 3600, // The timeout for the underlying process
    'ffmpeg.threads'   => 12,   // The number of threads that FFmpeg should use
];
    
$ffmpeg = Streaming\FFMpeg::create($config);
```

### Opening a File
There are several ways to open a file:

#### 1. From a Local Path
You can pass a local path of video to the `open` method:
``` php
$video = $ffmpeg->open('/var/www/media/videos/test.mp4');
```

#### 2. From a Cloud
You can open a file by passing a URL to the `fromURL` method:
``` php
$video = $ffmpeg->fromURL('https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/my_sweetie.mp4');
```

A path to save the file, the method of request, and **[request options](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/request-options.html)** can also be passed to the method.
``` php
$api = 'https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/api/v1.0';
$save_to = '/var/www/media/videos/my_sweetie.mp4';
$method = 'POST';
$current_percentage = 0;
$options = [
    'auth' => ['username', 'password', 'digest'],
    'form_params' => [
        'user'      => 'USER_ID',
        'method'    => 'download',
        'file'      => ['dir3', 'videos', 'my_sweetie.mp4']
    ],
    'headers' => [
        'User-Agent'        => 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; AminYazdanpanahBot/1.0; +http://aminyazdanpanah.com/bots)',
        'Accept'            => 'application/json',
        'Authorization'     => 'Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
    ],
    'progress' => function(
        $downloadTotal,
        $downloadedBytes,
        $uploadTotal,
        $uploadedBytes
    ) use (&$current_percentage) {
        $percentage = ($downloadTotal > 200) ? intval(($downloadedBytes / $downloadTotal) * 100) : 0;
        if ($current_percentage !== $percentage) {
            // You can update a field in your database
            // You can also create a socket connection and show the progress to users
            echo "$percentage% is downloaded\n";
            $current_percentage = $percentage;
        }
    },
];

$video = $ffmpeg->fromURL($api, $save_to, $method, $options);
```
**NOTE:** This package uses **[Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle)** to send and receive files. [Learn more](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/index.html).

#### 3. From Amazon S3
Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by **[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)** that provides object storage through a web service interface. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3)
- For getting credentials, you need to have an AWS account or you can **[create one](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)**.

For downloading a file from Amazon S3, you need to pass an associative array of options, the name of your bucket, and the key of your bucket to the `fromS3` method:
``` php
$config = [
    'version'     => 'latest',
    'region'      => 'us-west-1',
    'credentials' => [
        'key'    => 'my-access-key-id',
        'secret' => 'my-secret-access-key',
    ]
];
$bucket = 'my-bucket-name';
$key = '/videos/my_sweetie.mp4';

$video = $ffmpeg->fromS3($config, $bucket, $key);
```
A path can also be passed to save the file on your local machine.

#### 4. From Google Cloud Storage
**[Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage)** is a RESTful online file storage web service for storing and accessing data on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. The service combines the performance and scalability of Google's cloud with advanced security and sharing capabilities. It is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), comparable to Amazon S3 online storage service. Contrary to Google Drive and according to different service specifications, Google Cloud Storage appears to be more suitable for enterprises. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Storage)
- For creating credentials, read the Cloud Storage Authentication found **[here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication)** or you can **[create it](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)** directly (Select the "Service account key" option).

For downloading a file from Google Cloud Storage, you need to pass an associative array of config, the name of your bucket, and the name of your file in the bucket to the `fromGCS` method:
``` php
$config = [
    'keyFilePath' => '/path/to/credentials.json' // Alternativaely, you can authenticate by setting the environment variable. See https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#auth-cloud-implicit-php
];
$bucket = 'my_bucket';
$name = 'my_sweetie.mp4';

$video = $ffmpeg->fromGCS($config, $bucket, $name);
```
A path can also be passed to save the file on your local machine.

### DASH
**[Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)**, also known as MPEG-DASH, is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers.

Similar to Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) solution, MPEG-DASH works by breaking the content into a sequence of small HTTP-based file segments, each segment containing a short interval of playback time of content that is potentially many hours in duration, such as a movie or the live broadcast of a sports event. The content is made available at a variety of different bit rates, i.e., alternative segments encoded at different bit rates covering aligned short intervals of playback time. While the content is being played back by an MPEG-DASH client, the client uses a bit rate adaptation (ABR) algorithm to automatically select the segment with the highest bit rate possible that can be downloaded in time for playback without causing stalls or re-buffering events in the playback. The current MPEG-DASH reference client dash.js offers both buffer-based (BOLA) and hybrid (DYNAMIC) bit rate adaptation algorithms. Thus, an MPEG-DASH client can seamlessly adapt to changing network conditions and provide high quality playback with fewer stalls or re-buffering events. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)
 
Create DASH Files:
``` php
$video->DASH()
    ->HEVC() // Format of the video. Alternatives: X264() and VP9()
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations() // Auto generate representations
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a') // Set the adaption.
    ->save(); // It can be passed a path to the method or it can be null
```
You can also create multi-representations video files using the `Representation` object:
``` php
use Streaming\Representation;

$rep_1 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(800)->setResize(1080 , 720);
$rep_2 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(300)->setResize(640 , 360);

$video->DASH()
    ->HEVC()
    ->addRepresentation($rep_1) // Add a representation
    ->addRepresentation($rep_2) 
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a') // Set a adaption.
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/dash/test.mpd');
```
See **[DASH options](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#dash-2)** for more information.

### HLS
**[HTTP Live Streaming (also known as HLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)** is an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. as part of its QuickTime, Safari, OS X, and iOS software. Client implementations are also available in Microsoft Edge, Firefox and some versions of Google Chrome. Support is widespread in streaming media servers.

HLS resembles MPEG-DASH in that it works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small HTTP-based file downloads, each download loading one short chunk of an overall potentially unbounded transport stream. A list of available streams, encoded at different bit rates, is sent to the client using an extended M3U playlist. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)
 
Create HLS files based on original video(auto-generate qualities).
``` php
$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations([720, 360]) // You can limit the numbers of representatons
    ->save();
```
Create multi-qualities video files using the `Representation` object(set bit-rate and size manually):
``` php
use Streaming\Representation;

$rep_1 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(1000)->setResize(1080 , 720);
$rep_2 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(500)->setResize(640 , 360);
$rep_3 = (new Representation())->setKiloBitrate(200)->setResize(480 , 270);

$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->setHlsBaseUrl('https://bucket.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/videos') // Add a base URL
    ->addRepresentation($rep_1)
    ->addRepresentation($rep_2)
    ->addRepresentation($rep_3)
    ->setHlsTime(5) // Set Hls Time. Default value is 10 
    ->setHlsAllowCache(false) // Default value is true 
    ->save();
```
**NOTE:** You cannot use HEVC and VP9 formats for HLS packaging.

#### Encrypted HLS
The encryption process requires some kind of secret (key) together with an encryption algorithm. HLS uses AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. This means each block is encrypted using the ciphertext of the preceding block. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)

You need to pass both `URL to the key` and `path to save a random key` to the `generateRandomKeyInfo` method:
``` php
//A path you want to save a random key on your server
$save_to = '/var/www/my_website_project/keys/enc.key';

//A URL (or a path) to access the key on your website
$url = 'https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/keys/enc.key';// or '/keys/enc.key';

$video->HLS()
    ->X264()
    ->setTsSubDirectory('ts_files')// put all ts files in a subdirectory
    ->generateRandomKeyInfo($url, $save_to)
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations([1080, 480, 240])
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/hls/test.m3u8');
```
**NOTE:** It is very important to protect your key on your website using a token or a session/cookie(****It is highly recommended****).    

See **[HLS options](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#hls-2)** for more information.
### Transcoding
A format can also extend `FFMpeg\Format\ProgressableInterface` to get realtime information about the transcoding. 

``` php
$format = new Streaming\Format\HEVC();
$current_percentage = 0;

$format->on('progress', function ($video, $format, $percentage) use (&$current_percentage) {
    if ($current_percentage !== intval($percentage)) {
        // You can update a field in your database
        // You can also create a socket connection and show the progress to users
        echo "$percentage% is transcoded\n";
        $current_percentage = intval($percentage);
    }
});

$video->DASH()
    ->setFormat($format)
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations()
    ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a')
    ->save();
```
HLS Transcoding:
``` php
$format = new Streaming\Format\X264();
$current_percentage = 0;

$format->on('progress', function ($video, $format, $percentage) use (&$current_percentage) {
    if ($current_percentage !== intval($percentage)) {
        echo "$percentage% is transcoded\n";
        $current_percentage = intval($percentage);
    }
});

$video->HLS()
    ->setFormat($format)
    ->setTsSubDirectory('ts_files')
    ->setHlsBaseUrl('https://bucket.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/videos')
    ->autoGenerateRepresentations([240, 144], [200, 100]) // You can also set the kilo bite rate of each video
    ->save('/var/www/media/videos/dash/test.m3u8');
```
See **[Formats](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg#formats)** for more information.

### Saving Files
There are several options to save your packaged files.

#### 1. To a Local Path
You can pass a local path to the `save` method. If there was no directory in the path, then the package auto makes the directory.
``` php
$dash = $video->DASH()
            ->HEVC()
            ->autoGenerateRepresentations()
            ->setAdaption('id=0,streams=v id=1,streams=a');
            
$dash->save('/var/www/media/videos/dash/test.mpd');
```
It can also be null. The default path to save files is the input path.
``` php
$hls = $video->HLS()
            ->X264()
            ->autoGenerateRepresentations();
            
$hls->save();
```
**NOTE:** If you open a file from cloud and did not pass a path to save a file, you will have to pass a local path to the `save` method.

#### 2. To a Cloud
You can save your files to a cloud using the `saveToCloud` method. 
``` php
$api = 'https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/api/v1.0/video/uploading';
$field_name = 'MY_FILES';
$method = 'POST';
$headers = [
    'User-Agent'        => 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; AminYazdanpanahBot/1.0; +http://aminyazdanpanah.com/bots)',
    'Accept'            => 'application/json',
    'Authorization'     => 'Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
];
$current_percentage = 0;
$options = [
    'auth' => ['username', 'password', 'digest'],
    'progress' => function(
        $downloadTotal,
        $downloadedBytes,
        $uploadTotal,
        $uploadedBytes
    ) use (&$current_percentage) {
        $percentage = ($uploadTotal > 200) ? intval(($uploadedBytes / $uploadTotal) * 100) : 0;
        if ($current_percentage !== $percentage) {
            // You can update a field in your database
            // You can also create a socket connection and show the progress to users
            echo "$percentage% is uploaded\n";
            $current_percentage = $percentage;
        }
    },
];

$dash->saveToCloud($api, $field_name, null, $method, $headers, $options);
```
A path can also be passed to save a copy of files on your local machine:
``` php
$save_to = '/var/www/media/videos/hls/test.m3u8';
$hls->saveToCloud($api, $field_name, $save_to, $method, $headers, $options);
```

#### 3. TO Amazon S3
You can save and upload entire packaged video files to **[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/)**. For uploading files, you need to have credentials.
``` php
$config = [
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region' => 'us-west-1',
    'credentials' => [
        'key' => 'my-access-key-id',
        'secret' => 'my-secret-access-key',
    ]
];
$dest = 's3://bucket'; 
```
Upload DASH files to Amazon Simple Storage Service:
``` php
$dash->saveToS3($config, $dest);
```
A path can also be passed to save a copy of files on your local machine.
``` php
$hls->saveToS3($config, $dest, '/var/www/media/videos/hls/test.m3u8');
```

#### 4. TO Google Cloud Storage
You can save and upload entire packaged video files to **[Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage)**. For uploading files, you need to have credentials.
``` php
$config = [
    'keyFilePath' => '/path/to/credentials.json'
];
$bucket = 'my_bucket';

$dash->saveToGCS($config, $bucket);
```
A path can also be passed to save a copy of files on your local machine.
``` php
$hls->saveToGCS($config, $bucket, '/var/www/media/videos/hls/test.m3u8');
```

**NOTE:** You can mix opening and saving options together. For instance, you can open a file on your local machine and save packaged files to a Cloud (or vice versa).   

![schema](/docs/schema.gif?raw=true "schema" )

### Metadata Extraction
After saving files(wherever you saved them), you can extract the metadata from the video and streams:
``` php
$metadata = $hls->save();

echo $metadata['filename']; // path to metadata.json
var_dump($metadata['metadata']); // dump all metadata
```
**NOTE:** You can save these metadata to your database.

### Other Advanced Features
You can easily use other advanced features in the **[PHP-FFMpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg)** library. In fact, when you open a file with the `open` method(or `fromURL`), it holds the Media object that belongs to the PHP-FFMpeg.
``` php
$ffmpeg = Streaming\FFMpeg::create()
$video = $$ffmpeg->fromURL('https://www.aminyazdanpanah.com/my_sweetie.mp4', '/var/wwww/media/my/new/video.mp4');
```

#### Example(Extracting image)
You can extract a frame at any timecode using the `FFMpeg\Media\Video::frame` method.
``` php
$frame = $video->frame(FFMpeg\Coordinate\TimeCode::fromSeconds(42));
$frame->save('image.jpg');
```

## Asynchronous Task Execution
Packaging process will may take a while and it is recommended to run it in the background(or in a cloud e.g. Google Cloud). There are some libraries that you can use.
- **[Symphony(The Console Component)](https://github.com/symfony/console):** You can use this library to create command-line commands. Your console commands can be used for any recurring task, such as cronjobs, imports, or other batch jobs. [Learn more](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html#learn-more)

- **[Laravel(Queues)](https://github.com/illuminate/queue):** If you are using Laravel for development, Laravel Queues is a wonderful tool for this use case. It allows you to create a job and dispatch it. [Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/6.0/queues)

- **[Google Cloud Tasks](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php-tasks):** Google Cloud Tasks is a fully managed service that allows you to manage the execution, dispatch, and delivery of a large number of distributed tasks. You can asynchronously perform work outside of a user request. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/)

**NOTE:** It is not necessary to use these libraries. It is just a suggestion. You can also create a script to create packaged video files and run a job in the cron job.  

## Several Open Source Players
You can use these libraries to play your streams.
